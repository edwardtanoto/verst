                <p>Modern days dating apps have incentives to make you lonelier to keep you using the app. 
                  However, what if we can replace a dating app into something more meaningful? Here are some quotes from a reliable source:</p>
                <br />
                <blockquote>
                "We are the Monogatrons. While your species was still toying with fire, ours mastered the science of functioning, committed relationships. As the latest planet to develop our app, you will now witness the true power of superior intimacy."
                </blockquote>
                <br/>
                <blockquote>
                "As a preapp civilization, your love's value is defined by scarcity. You are highly trained to seek it, and you have no idea how to maintain it. Had you bothered to master love, you would've learned by now, it is as abundant as water."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Okay we hope Rick and Morty won't sue us for stealing that line, but personally speaking, we are done. If you have taken your time to <a href='https://www.online-toolz.com/tools/text-encryption-decryption.php' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>decrypt</a> the [<span style={{color:'#FF8989'}}>word</span>], please open [<span style={{color:'#FF8989'}}>word</span>].verst.io (Example: example.verst.io, replace example with the [<span style={{color:'#FF8989'}}>word</span>]). Something is waiting you there.</p>
